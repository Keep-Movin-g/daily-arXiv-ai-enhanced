Abstract: In order for large language models to achieve true conversational continuity
and benefit from experiential learning, they need memory. While research has
focused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which
types of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We
present a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a
benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering
tasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context
prompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic
memory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory
through prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches
reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory
architecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small
foundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned
reasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more
complex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs
recognise the limits of their own knowledge.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
complex techniques like extreme quantization and dynamic routing. While
individual benefits of these methods are well-documented, their compositional
effects remain poorly understood. This paper introduces BitSkip, a hybrid
architectural framework for systematically explor- ing these interactions.
Counter-intuitively, our findings reveal that a simple 8-bit quantized model
without Hadamard transform (BitSkip-V1) not only outperforms its more complex
4-bit and Hadamard-enhanced counterparts but also competes the full-precision
baseline in quality (perplexity of 1.13 vs 1.19) . The introduction of Hadamard
transforms, even at 8- bit precision, catastrophically degraded performance by
over 37,000%, tracing fundamental training instability. Our BitSkip-V1 recipe
demonstrates superior early-exit characteristics, with layer 18 providing
optimal 32.5% speed gain for minimal 4% quality loss.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to process culturally grounded language, specifically to understand and
pragmatically use figurative expressions that encode local knowledge and
cultural nuance. Using figurative language as a proxy for cultural nuance and
local knowledge, we design evaluation tasks for contextual understanding,
pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation in Arabic and English. We
evaluate 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on Egyptian Arabic idioms,
multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Our results show a
consistent hierarchy: the average accuracy for Arabic proverbs is 4.29% lower
than for English proverbs, and performance for Egyptian idioms is 10.28% lower
than for Arabic proverbs. For the pragmatic use task, accuracy drops by 14.07%
relative to understanding, though providing contextual idiomatic sentences
improves accuracy by 10.66%. Models also struggle with connotative meaning,
reaching at most 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with 100%
inter-annotator agreement. These findings demonstrate that figurative language
serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning: while LLMs can often
interpret figurative meaning, they face challenges in using it appropriately.
To support future research, we release Kinayat, the first dataset of Egyptian
Arabic idioms designed for both figurative understanding and pragmatic use
evaluation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art sign language models are trained on interpreter or
isolated vocabulary data, which overlooks the variability that characterizes
natural dialogue. However, human communication dynamically adapts to contexts
and interlocutors through spatiotemporal changes and articulation style. This
specifically manifests itself in educational settings, where novel vocabularies
are used by teachers, and students. To address this gap, we collect a motion
capture dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) dialogue that enables quantitative comparison
between dyadic interactive signing, solo signed lecture, and interpreted
articles. Using continuous kinematic features, we disentangle dialogue-specific
entrainment from individual effort reduction and show spatiotemporal changes
across repeated mentions of STEM terms. On average, dialogue signs are
24.6%-44.6% shorter in duration than the isolated signs, and show significant
reductions absent in monologue contexts. Finally, we evaluate sign embedding
models on their ability to recognize STEM signs and approximate how entrained
the participants become over time. Our study bridges linguistic analysis and
computational modeling to understand how pragmatics shape sign articulation and
its representation in sign language technologies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Detecting mental health crisis situations such as suicide ideation, rape,
domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual harassment is a critical yet
underexplored challenge for language models. When such situations arise during
user--model interactions, models must reliably flag them, as failure to do so
can have serious consequences. In this work, we introduce CRADLE BENCH, a
benchmark for multi-faceted crisis detection. Unlike previous efforts that
focus on a limited set of crisis types, our benchmark covers seven types
defined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate
temporal labels. Our benchmark provides 600 clinician-annotated evaluation
examples and 420 development examples, together with a training corpus of
around 4K examples automatically labeled using a majority-vote ensemble of
multiple language models, which significantly outperforms single-model
annotation. We further fine-tune six crisis detection models on subsets defined
by consensus and unanimous ensemble agreement, providing complementary models
trained under different agreement criteria.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language model agents are increasingly used in multi-turn
conversational settings to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic
environments. However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by
default, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the
real-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability
when an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has
passed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often
either over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or
under-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,
we introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across
34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user
question, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed
since the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue
messages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and
evolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples,
creating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous
observation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call
(prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with
human preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show
that without time information, most models perform only slightly better than
random, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding
timestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the
improvement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive,
prompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness. Our findings highlight the
need for specific post-training alignment to align multi-turn LLM tool use with
human temporal perception.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In modern industry systems like multi-turn chat agents, Text-to-SQL
technology bridges natural language (NL) questions and database (DB) querying.
The conversion of tabular DB results into NL representations (NLRs) enables the
chat-based interaction. Currently, NLR generation is typically handled by large
language models (LLMs), but information loss or errors in presenting tabular
results in NL remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel
evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that
combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation
fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%.
Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR
benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment
of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and
without ground truth references.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present OraPlan-SQL, our system for the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge
2025, a bilingual benchmark requiring complex reasoning such as arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical inference. OraPlan-SQL ranked first, exceeding
the second-best system by more than 6% in execution accuracy (EX), with 55.0%
in English and 56.7% in Chinese, while maintaining over 99% SQL validity (VA).
Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that
generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these
plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our
refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple
sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a
feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure
cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills
them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system
prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual
scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate
entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities
and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability
through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each
query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output
selected via majority voting over their executions.

Abstract: Text embeddings are an essential building component of several NLP tasks such
as retrieval-augmented generation which is crucial for preventing
hallucinations in LLMs. Despite the recent release of massively multilingual
MTEB (MMTEB), African languages remain underrepresented, with existing tasks
often repurposed from translation benchmarks such as FLORES clustering or
SIB-200. In this paper, we introduce AfriMTEB -- a regional expansion of MMTEB
covering 59 languages, 14 tasks, and 38 datasets, including six newly added
datasets. Unlike many MMTEB datasets that include fewer than five languages,
the new additions span 14 to 56 African languages and introduce entirely new
tasks, such as hate speech detection, intent detection, and emotion
classification, which were not previously covered. Complementing this, we
present AfriE5, an adaptation of the instruction-tuned mE5 model to African
languages through cross-lingual contrastive distillation. Our evaluation shows
that AfriE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong
baselines such as Gemini-Embeddings and mE5.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to demonstrate stereotypical biases in
their representations and behavior due to the discriminative nature of the data
that they have been trained on. Despite significant progress in the development
of methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in
their decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias
alignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general
augmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is
applicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application
of augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question
Answering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including
state-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to
perturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave
stereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have
biased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community
less studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and
safety research to include more diverse communities.

Abstract: We present a novel agent-based approach for the automated claim matching task
with instruction-following LLMs. We propose a two-step pipeline that first
generates prompts with LLMs, to then perform claim matching as a binary
classification task with LLMs. We demonstrate that LLM-generated prompts can
outperform SOTA with human-generated prompts, and that smaller LLMs can do as
well as larger ones in the generation process, allowing to save computational
resources. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using different LLMs for
each step of the pipeline, i.e. using an LLM for prompt generation, and another
for claim matching. Our investigation into the prompt generation process in
turn reveals insights into the LLMs' understanding of claim matching.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a novel, training free cascade for auto-prompting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assess product quality in e-commerce. Our system requires no
training labels or model fine-tuning, instead automatically generating and
refining prompts for evaluating attribute quality across tens of thousands of
product category-attribute pairs. Starting from a seed of human-crafted
prompts, the cascade progressively optimizes instructions to meet
catalog-specific requirements. This approach bridges the gap between general
language understanding and domain-specific knowledge at scale in complex
industrial catalogs. Our extensive empirical evaluations shows the auto-prompt
cascade improves precision and recall by $8-10\%$ over traditional
chain-of-thought prompting. Notably, it achieves these gains while reducing
domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute - a $99\%$
reduction. Additionally, the cascade generalizes effectively across five
languages and multiple quality assessment tasks, consistently maintaining
performance gains.

Abstract: There have been a couple of studies showing that attempting to erase
multilingual knowledge using only English data is insufficient for multilingual
LLMs. However, their analyses remain highly performance-oriented. In this
paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional
blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned
with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion
occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input
prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing
the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in
three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to
quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in
multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false
negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of
unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated
sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated potential in enhancing
medical question-answering systems through the integration of large language
models (LLMs) with external medical literature. LLMs can retrieve relevant
medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently. However,
current RAG applications still face problems. They generate incorrect
information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge
correctly. To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval. This
method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in
Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG
responses using evidence from multiple sources. First, we extract additional
medical literature from external knowledge bases. Then, we retrieve the
evidence documents generated by the RAG system. We use heterogeneity analysis
to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response. In
addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the
reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system. Our method shows an
improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs. This work can help
detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems. It also makes the
applications of LLMs more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) research has always been of paramount
importance. It is important to find appropriate medical theoretical support for
the needs from physicians or patients to reduce the occurrence of medical
accidents. This process is often carried out by human querying relevant
literature databases, which lacks objectivity and efficiency. Therefore,
researchers utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to search for evidence
and generate responses automatically. However, current RAG methods struggle to
handle complex queries in real-world clinical scenarios. For example, when
queries lack certain information or use imprecise language, the model may
retrieve irrelevant evidence and generate unhelpful answers. To address this
issue, we present the PICOs-RAG to expand the user queries into a better
format. Our method can expand and normalize the queries into professional ones
and use the PICO format, a search strategy tool present in EBM, to extract the
most important information used for retrieval. This approach significantly
enhances retrieval efficiency and relevance, resulting in up to an 8.8\%
improvement compared to the baseline evaluated by our method. Thereby the
PICOs-RAG improves the performance of the large language models into a helpful
and reliable medical assistant in EBM.

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) holds a crucial role in clinical application.
Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of
misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs)
techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent
requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently
distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis
used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical
evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence
for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate
the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis,
and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the
best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality
articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and
results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more
reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of
incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective
replies.

Abstract: The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge
from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to
the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We
propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE
output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a
document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the
database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction.
This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and
adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate
this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as
data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an
LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer
component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that
generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component
that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments
show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating
different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight
difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies
and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for
their reliable deployment. Existing methods typically fine-tune LLMs to abstain
from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope. However, these methods
often rely on coarse-grained signals to guide LLMs to abstain, such as overall
confidence or uncertainty scores on multiple sampled answers, which may result
in an imprecise awareness of the model's own knowledge boundaries. To this end,
we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on
$\textbf{\underline{Fi}ne-grained \underline{S}emantic \underline{Co}nfidence
\underline{Re}ward (\Ours)}$, which guides LLMs to abstain via sample-specific
confidence. Specifically, our method operates by sampling multiple candidate
answers and conducting semantic clustering, then training the LLM to retain
answers within high-confidence clusters and discard those within low-confidence
ones, thereby promoting accurate post-hoc abstention. Additionally, we propose
a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention fine-tuning tasks
more comprehensively. Our method significantly enhances reliability in both
in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone technique for
compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student
models. However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation
loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This
indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn
from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately
harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more
powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation
(SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic,
token-level gating mechanism inspired by the "propose-and-verify" paradigm of
speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified
against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively
applied only to "accepted" tokens, while "rejected" tokens are masked out.
Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD
consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more
stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art
results.

Abstract: Humans leverage shared conversational context to become increasingly
successful and efficient at communicating over time. One manifestation of this
is the formation of ad hoc linguistic conventions, which allow people to
coordinate on short, less costly utterances that are understood using shared
conversational context. We present a method to train large multimodal models to
form conventions, enabling efficient communication. Our approach uses simulated
reference games between models, and requires no additional human-produced data.
In repeated reference games involving photographs and tangram images, our
method enables models to communicate efficiently with people: reducing the
message length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over the course of
the interaction. Human listeners respond faster when interacting with our model
that forms conventions. We also show that training based on success or cost
alone is insufficient - both are necessary to elicit convention formation.

Abstract: Emerging large language model (LLM) applications involve diverse reasoning
strategies and agentic workflows, straining the capabilities of existing
serving systems built on a monolithic token generation loop. This paper
introduces Pie, a programmable LLM serving system designed for flexibility and
efficiency. Pie decomposes the traditional generation loop into fine-grained
service handlers exposed via an API and delegates control of the generation
process to user-provided programs, called inferlets. This enables applications
to implement new KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and seamlessly
integrate computation and I/O-entirely within the application, without
requiring modifications to the serving system. Pie executes inferlets using
WebAssembly, benefiting from its lightweight sandboxing. Our evaluation shows
Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency
overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x
higher) on agentic workflows by enabling application-specific optimizations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced machine translation but remain
vulnerable to hallucinations. Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not
capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in
multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that
separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this
taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark
across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate
candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and
expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances. We have
evaluated 17 LLMs on HalloMTBench. Results reveal distinct ``hallucination
triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length
sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified
language mixing. HalloMTBench offers a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing
LLM translation failures. HalloMTBench is available in
https://huggingface.co/collections/AIDC-AI/marco-mt.

Abstract: To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for
large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and
cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense
reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335
researchers from 65 countries around the world. The 116 language varieties in
Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing
systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples
reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific
elements. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in
aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up
to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally
perform worse than proprietary models. Global PIQA highlights that in many
languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement,
alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and
expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA
provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language
is embedded.

Abstract: The Bengali language, spoken extensively across South Asia and among
diasporic communities, exhibits considerable dialectal diversity shaped by
geography, culture, and history. Phonological and pronunciation-based
classifications broadly identify five principal dialect groups: Eastern
Bengali, Manbhumi, Rangpuri, Varendri, and Rarhi. Within Bangladesh, further
distinctions emerge through variation in vocabulary, syntax, and morphology, as
observed in regions such as Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Noakhali,
and Barishal. Despite this linguistic richness, systematic research on the
computational processing of Bengali dialects remains limited. This study seeks
to document and analyze the phonetic and morphological properties of these
dialects while exploring the feasibility of building computational models
particularly Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems tailored to regional
varieties. Such efforts hold potential for applications in virtual assistants
and broader language technologies, contributing to both the preservation of
dialectal diversity and the advancement of inclusive digital tools for
Bengali-speaking communities. The dataset created for this study is released
for public use.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL technology has evolved rapidly, with diverse academic methods
achieving impressive results. However, deploying these techniques in real-world
systems remains challenging due to limited integration tools. Despite these
advances, we introduce Squrve, a unified, modular, and extensive Text-to-SQL
framework designed to bring together research advances and real-world
applications. Squrve first establishes a universal execution paradigm that
standardizes invocation interfaces, then proposes a multi-actor collaboration
mechanism based on seven abstracted effective atomic actor components.
Experiments on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that the collaborative
workflows consistently outperform the original individual methods, thereby
opening up a new effective avenue for tackling complex real-world queries. The

addition, we explore turn-restricted regimes, during training and at test-time,
that show these agents achieve better results if allowed to operate over longer
multi-turn horizons.

Abstract: While traditional line-level filtering techniques, such as line-level

methods can sometimes discard valuable content, negatively affecting downstream
performance. In this paper, we introduce two methods-pattern-aware line-level
deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF)-by
enhancing the conventional filtering techniques. Our approach not only
considers line-level signals but also takes into account their sequential
distribution across documents, enabling us to retain structurally important
content that might otherwise be removed. We evaluate these proposed methods by
training small language models (1 B parameters) in both English and Korean. The
results demonstrate that our methods consistently improve performance on
multiple-choice benchmarks and significantly enhance generative
question-answering accuracy on both SQuAD v1 and KorQuAD v1.

for logical consistency and answerability. Evaluations of four large language
models -- two multilingual and two Korean-specialized -- show that multilingual
models outperform Korean-focused ones even in Korean reasoning tasks,
indicating cross-lingual generalization of reasoning ability. Carefully
designed prompting strategies, which combine few-shot examples, reasoning
traces, and task-specific hints, further boost accuracy, approaching
human-level performance. Ko-MuSR offers a solid foundation for advancing Korean
NLP by enabling systematic evaluation of long-context reasoning and prompting
strategies.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex form of figurative language in which the intended
meaning contradicts the literal one. Its prevalence in social media and popular
culture poses persistent challenges for natural language understanding,
sentiment analysis, and content moderation. With the emergence of multimodal
large language models, sarcasm detection extends beyond text and requires
integrating cues from audio and vision. We present MuSaG, the first German
multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually
selected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each
instance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated
separately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings.
We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio,
vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human
annotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in
conversational settings, models perform best on text. This highlights a gap in
current multimodal models and motivates the use of MuSaG for developing models
better suited to realistic scenarios. We release MuSaG publicly to support
future research on multimodal sarcasm detection and human-model alignment.

Abstract: This paper explores the influence of external knowledge integration in
Natural Language Generation (NLG), focusing on a commonsense generation task.
We extend the CommonGen dataset by creating KITGI, a benchmark that pairs input
concept sets with retrieved semantic relations from ConceptNet and includes
manually annotated outputs. Using the T5-Large model, we compare sentence
generation under two conditions: with full external knowledge and with filtered
knowledge where highly relevant relations were deliberately removed. Our
interpretability benchmark follows a three-stage method: (1) identifying and
removing key knowledge, (2) regenerating sentences, and (3) manually assessing
outputs for commonsense plausibility and concept coverage. Results show that
sentences generated with full knowledge achieved 91\% correctness across both
criteria, while filtering reduced performance drastically to 6\%. These
findings demonstrate that relevant external knowledge is critical for
maintaining both coherence and concept coverage in NLG. This work highlights
the importance of designing interpretable, knowledge-enhanced NLG systems and
calls for evaluation frameworks that capture the underlying reasoning beyond
surface-level metrics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of knowledge in their
massive parameters, which is accessible to locate, trace, and analyze. Despite
advances in neural interpretability, it is still not clear how to transfer
knowledge in a fine-grained manner, namely parametric knowledge transfer (PKT).
A key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across
LLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility
and broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural
incompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences
between LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer
parameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic
alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale
knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our
approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.
Leveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and
outperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales.
Evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further
analysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and
provides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage.
Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external
properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This
external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation
strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for
categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since
parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization
method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that
differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis,
we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those
occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To
validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation,
which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model
activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge
categorization by showing a significant difference between the two
hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and
hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do
occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we
identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models
hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We
introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation
methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on
average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in
hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that
consider the hallucination underlying factors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not
faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare
settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit
salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust
and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time
choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can
control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA
8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions),
and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies,
and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of
few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is
sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves
measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies
for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive
domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the Diacritic Restoration (DR) task for Arabic
dialectal sentences using a multimodal approach that combines both textual and
speech information. We propose a model that represents the text modality using
an encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech
component is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model.
Our solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former
consists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where
the 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames,
resulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these
averaged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to
merging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the
CATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text
and speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the
CATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further
improve model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during
training, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech. Our
experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a word error rate (WER) of
0.25 and a character error rate (CER) of 0.9 on the development set. On the
test set, our model achieved WER and CER scores of 0.55 and 0.13, respectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), predominantly trained on adult conversational

dialogue for specialized applications. We present a comparative study
evaluating five different LLMs (GPT-4, RUTER-LLAMA-2-13b, GPTSW, NorMistral-7b,
and NorBloom-7b) to generate age-appropriate Norwegian conversations for
children aged 5 and 9 years. Through a blind evaluation by eleven education
professionals using both real child interview data and LLM-generated text
samples, we assessed authenticity and developmental appropriateness. Our
results show that evaluators achieved strong inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.75)
and demonstrated higher accuracy in age prediction for younger children
(5-year-olds) compared to older children (9-year-olds). While GPT-4 and
NorBloom-7b performed relatively well, most models generated language perceived
as more linguistically advanced than the target age groups. These findings
highlight critical data-related challenges in developing LLM systems for
specialized applications involving children, particularly in low-resource
languages where comprehensive age-appropriate lexical resources are scarce.

Abstract: We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and
show that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs)
and vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss
landscape curvature. This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical
work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper
than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low
curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a
weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted
memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method
(BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of
curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights,
we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks
in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and
consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and
general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on
specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms,
regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support
this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with
low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance
after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural
networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence
for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math
and fact retrieval.

Abstract: Emergent symbolic representations are critical for enabling developmental
learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks. In this work, we
investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can translate human natural
language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge
during hierarchical reinforcement learning. We apply a structured evaluation
framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT,
Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions
generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze
and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate
some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of
the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition
granularity and task complexity. The results expose limitations in current LLMs
capacity for representation alignment, highlighting the need for further
research on robust alignment between language and internal agent
representations.

Abstract: In recent years, many generalization benchmarks have shown language models'
lack of robustness in natural language inference (NLI). However, manually
creating new benchmarks is costly, while automatically generating high-quality
ones, even by modifying existing benchmarks, is extremely difficult. In this
paper, we propose a methodology for automatically generating high-quality
variants of original NLI problems by replacing open-class words, while
crucially preserving their underlying reasoning. We dub our generalization test
as MERGE (Minimal Expression-Replacements GEneralization), which evaluates the
correctness of models' predictions across reasoning-preserving variants of the
original problem. Our results show that NLI models' perform 4-20% worse on
variants, suggesting low generalizability even on such minimally altered
problems. We also analyse how word class of the replacements, word probability,
and plausibility influence NLI models' performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly with
algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has proven highly
effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
However, a critical bottleneck in current pipelines lies in the limited
diversity of sampled trajectories during group rollouts. Homogeneous
trajectories and their associated rewards would diminish the return signals for
policy updates, thereby hindering effective policy learning. This lack of
diversity stems primarily from token-level stochastic sampling, where local
variations are likely to collapse into near-identical reasoning paths. To
address this limitation, we propose Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR), a
novel rollout strategy designed to explicitly promotes trajectory-level
diversity by enforcing branching into different candidate tokens likely to
yield distinct continuations. Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three
stages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing
lookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that
exhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic
Sampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves
final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy
Optimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks. Our code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/starreeze/latr.

Abstract: Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model
outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for
annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL
approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger
supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor
generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the
response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward
signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to
unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive
feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response
is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.
To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In
stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct
rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on
actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its
discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across
various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance
improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a
5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer everyday
questions, yet their performance on culturally grounded and dialectal content
remains uneven across languages. We propose a comprehensive method that (i)
translates Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) multiple-choice questions (MCQs) into
English and several Arabic dialects, (ii) converts them into open-ended
questions (OEQs), (iii) benchmarks a range of zero-shot and fine-tuned LLMs
under both MCQ and OEQ settings, and (iv) generates chain-of-thought (CoT)
rationales to fine-tune models for step-by-step reasoning. Using this method,
we extend an existing dataset in which QAs are parallelly aligned across
multiple language varieties, making it, to our knowledge, the first of its
kind. We conduct extensive experiments with both open and closed models. Our
findings show that (i) models underperform on Arabic dialects, revealing
persistent gaps in culturally grounded and dialect-specific knowledge; (ii)
Arabic-centric models perform well on MCQs but struggle with OEQs; and (iii)
CoT improves judged correctness while yielding mixed n-gram-based metrics. The
developed dataset will be publicly released to support further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive evaluation.

Abstract: Generating long, informative, and factual outputs remains a major challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks for long-form generation
typically assess real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or use
synthetic setups that ease evaluation but overlook real-world intricacies. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{LongWeave}, which balances real-world and
verifiable assessment with Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval). CoV-Eval
constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within real-world
scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual
materials, and constraints based on these targets. This ensures that tasks are
both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of
model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave
supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven
distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models
encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world
complexity and output length increase.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings can be decoded to give approximations of the original
texts used to create them. We explore this effect in the context of text
simplification, demonstrating that reconstructed text embeddings preserve
complexity levels. We experiment with a small feed forward neural network to
effectively learn a transformation between sentence embeddings representing
high-complexity and low-complexity texts. We provide comparison to a Seq2Seq
and LLM-based approach, showing encouraging results in our much smaller
learning setting. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our
transformation to an unseen simplification dataset (MedEASI), as well as
datasets from languages outside the training data (ES,DE). We conclude that
learning transformations in sentence embedding space is a promising direction
for future research and has potential to unlock the ability to develop small,
but powerful models for text simplification and other natural language
generation tasks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with limited data poses a practical
challenge in low-resource languages, specialized domains, and constrained
deployment settings. While pre-trained LLMs provide strong foundations,
effective adaptation under data scarcity requires focused and efficient
fine-tuning techniques. This paper presents a structured and practical survey
of recent methods for fine-tuning LLMs in data-scarce scenarios. We
systematically review parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques that lower
training and deployment costs, domain and cross-lingual adaptation methods for
both encoder and decoder models, and model specialization strategies. We
further examine preference alignment approaches that guide model behavior using
limited human or synthetic feedback, emphasizing sample and compute efficiency.
Throughout, we highlight empirical trade-offs, selection criteria, and best
practices for choosing suitable techniques based on task constraints, including
model scaling, data scaling, and the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting. The
aim is to equip researchers and practitioners with actionable insights for
effectively fine-tuning LLMs when data and resources are limited.

Abstract: Recent efforts leverage knowledge distillation techniques to develop
lightweight and practical sentiment analysis models. These methods are grounded
in human-written instructions and large-scale user texts. Despite the promising
results, two key challenges remain: (1) manually written instructions are
limited in diversity and quantity, making them insufficient to ensure
comprehensive coverage of distilled knowledge; (2) large-scale user texts incur
high computational cost, hindering the practicality of these methods. To this
end, we introduce COMPEFFDIST, a comprehensive and efficient distillation
framework for sentiment analysis. Our framework consists of two key modules:
attribute-based automatic instruction construction and difficulty-based data
filtering, which correspondingly tackle the aforementioned challenges. Applying
our method across multiple model series (Llama-3, Qwen-3, and Gemma-3), we
enable 3B student models to match the performance of 20x larger teacher models
on most tasks. In addition, our approach greatly outperforms baseline methods
in data efficiency, attaining the same performance level with only 10% of the
data.

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning ability of language models (LMs) is complicated by
their extensive parametric world knowledge, where benchmark performance often
reflects factual recall rather than genuine reasoning. Existing datasets and
approaches (e.g., temporal filtering, paraphrasing, adversarial substitution)
cannot cleanly separate the two. We present SynthWorlds, a framework that
disentangles task reasoning complexity from factual knowledge. In SynthWorlds,
we construct parallel corpora representing two worlds with identical
interconnected structure: a real-mapped world, where models may exploit
parametric knowledge, and a synthetic-mapped world, where such knowledge is
meaningless. On top of these corpora, we design two mirrored tasks as case
studies: multi-hop question answering and page navigation, which maintain equal
reasoning difficulty across worlds. Experiments in parametric-only (e.g.,
closed-book QA) and knowledge-augmented (e.g., retrieval-augmented) LM settings
reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap, defined as the performance boost
models gain from memorized parametric world knowledge. Knowledge acquisition
and integration mechanisms reduce but do not eliminate this gap, highlighting
opportunities for system improvements. Fully automatic and scalable,
SynthWorlds provides a controlled environment for evaluating LMs in ways that
were previously challenging, enabling precise and testable comparisons of
reasoning and memorization.

Abstract: The effectiveness of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is often

the dataset from a corpus of native Luxembourgish texts, utilizing
DeepSeek-R1-0528, chosen for its shown proficiency in Luxembourgish. Following
generation, we apply a quality assurance process, employing an LLM-as-a-judge
approach. To investigate the practical utility of the dataset, we fine-tune
several smaller-scale LLMs on LuxIT. Subsequent benchmarking against their base
models on Luxembourgish language proficiency examinations, however, yields
mixed results, with performance varying significantly across different models.
LuxIT represents a critical contribution to Luxembourgish natural language
processing and offers a replicable monolingual methodology, though our findings
highlight the need for further research to optimize its application.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for Islamic guidance, but risk
misquoting texts, misapplying jurisprudence, or producing culturally
inconsistent responses. We pilot an evaluation of GPT-4o, Ansari AI, and Fanar
on prompts from authentic Islamic blogs. Our dual-agent framework uses a
quantitative agent for citation verification and six-dimensional scoring (e.g.,
Structure, Islamic Consistency, Citations) and a qualitative agent for
five-dimensional side-by-side comparison (e.g., Tone, Depth, Originality).
GPT-4o scored highest in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38), Ansari AI
followed (3.68, 3.32), and Fanar lagged (2.76, 1.82). Despite relatively strong
performance, models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic
content and citations -- a paramount requirement in faith-sensitive writing.
GPT-4o had the highest mean quantitative score (3.90/5), while Ansari AI led
qualitative pairwise wins (116/200). Fanar, though trailing, introduces
innovations for Islamic and Arabic contexts. This study underscores the need
for community-driven benchmarks centering Muslim perspectives, offering an
early step toward more reliable AI in Islamic knowledge and other high-stakes
domains such as medicine, law, and journalism.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in vision-language tasks such as reasoning segmentation, where models generate
segmentation masks based on textual queries. While prior work has primarily
focused on perturbing image inputs, semantically equivalent textual
paraphrases-crucial in real-world applications where users express the same
intent in varied ways-remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a
novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct
paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading
segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases,
we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human
studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level
optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space
of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves
significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on
both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive
baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models.
We reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under
strict semantic and grammatical constraints. All code and data will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

Abstract: Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent
text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus.
Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich
profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and
often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a
unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization
through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM
generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic
LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on
tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then
revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across
iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as
Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,
Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization
over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5
refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These
results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful
paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and
model-agnostic.

Reference Prediction from Talks (RPT), a new task that maps long, and
unstructured scientific presentations to relevant papers. To support research

containing 6,279 talks and 43,429 cited papers (26 per talk on average), where
relevance is approximated by the papers cited in the talk's corresponding
source publication. We establish strong baselines by evaluating
state-of-the-art text embedding models in zero-shot retrieval scenarios, and
propose a dual-encoder architecture trained on Talk2Ref. We further explore
strategies for handling long transcripts, as well as training for domain
adaptation. Our results show that fine-tuning on Talk2Ref significantly
improves citation prediction performance, demonstrating both the challenges of
the task and the effectiveness of our dataset for learning semantic

Abstract: As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our
lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and
evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit
rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess
the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel
word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs
based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association
networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational
structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative
assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method
enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a
valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of
LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we
apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social
biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between
LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of
using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and
generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple
LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible
language technologies.

Abstract: Accurate confidence calibration in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical
for safe use in high-stakes domains, where clear verbalized confidence enhances
user trust. Traditional methods that mimic reference confidence expressions
often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment.
We propose natural language critiques as a solution, ideally suited for
confidence calibration, as precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain
and often require multiple generations. This paper studies how natural language
critiques can enhance verbalized confidence, addressing: (1) What to critique:
uncertainty (question-focused) or confidence (answer-specific)? Analysis shows
confidence suits multiple-choice tasks, while uncertainty excels in open-ended
scenarios. (2) How to critique: self-critique or critique calibration training?
We propose Self-Critique, enabling LLMs to critique and optimize their
confidence beyond mere accuracy, and CritiCal, a novel Critique Calibration
training method that leverages natural language critiques to improve confidence
calibration, moving beyond direct numerical optimization. Experiments show that
CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive
baselines, even surpassing its teacher model, GPT-4o, in complex reasoning
tasks. CritiCal also shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution
settings, advancing LLM's reliability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Many words are ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). However,
when a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.
Disambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS
associated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.
The problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language
processing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,
expression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.
Lexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural
language processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce
multiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct
solution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence
rate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is
unrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a
lexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate
and implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal
description of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation
grammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer
paths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a
combination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by
considering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling
of a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come
spontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often
due to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is
targeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed
specification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be
necessary.

Abstract: Textual humor is enormously diverse and computational studies need to account
for this range, including intentionally bad humor. In this paper, we curate and
analyze a novel corpus of sentences from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest to
better understand "bad" humor in English. Standard humor detection models
perform poorly on our corpus, and an analysis of literary devices finds that
these sentences combine features common in existing humor datasets (e.g., puns,
irony) with metaphor, metafiction and simile. LLMs prompted to synthesize
contest-style sentences imitate the form but exaggerate the effect by
over-using certain literary devices, and including far more novel
adjective-noun bigrams than human writers. Data, code and analysis are

Abstract: The history of the Korean language is characterized by a discrepancy between
its spoken and written forms and a pivotal shift from Chinese characters to the
Hangul alphabet. However, this linguistic evolution has remained largely
unexplored in NLP due to a lack of accessible historical corpora. To address
this gap, we introduce the Open Korean Historical Corpus, a large-scale, openly
licensed dataset spanning 1,300 years and 6 languages, as well as
under-represented writing systems like Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and
Hanja-Hangul mixed script. This corpus contains 18 million documents and 5
billion tokens from 19 sources, ranging from the 7th century to 2025. We
leverage this resource to quantitatively analyze major linguistic shifts: (1)
Idu usage peaked in the 1860s before declining sharply; (2) the transition from
Hanja to Hangul was a rapid transformation starting around 1890; and (3) North
Korea's lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51 times
higher out-of-vocabulary rates. This work provides a foundational resource for
quantitative diachronic analysis by capturing the history of the Korean
language. Moreover, it can serve as a pre-training corpus for large language
models, potentially improving their understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary in
modern Hangul as well as archaic writing systems.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, despite large multilingual
training, struggle in out-of-domain and low-resource scenarios where labeled
data is scarce. We propose BEARD (BEST-RQ Encoder Adaptation with Re-training
and Distillation), a novel framework designed to adapt Whisper's encoder using
unlabeled data. Unlike traditional self-supervised learning methods, BEARD
uniquely combines a BEST-RQ objective with knowledge distillation from a frozen
teacher encoder, ensuring the encoder's complementarity with the pre-trained
decoder. Our experiments focus on the ATCO2 corpus from the challenging Air
Traffic Control (ATC) communications domain, characterized by non-native
speech, noise, and specialized phraseology. Using about 5,000 hours of
untranscribed speech for BEARD and 2 hours of transcribed speech for
fine-tuning, the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous baseline
and fine-tuned model, achieving a relative improvement of 12% compared to the
fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use a
self-supervised learning objective for domain adaptation of Whisper.

Abstract: Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants,
and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows.
However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the
underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as
research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework
that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the
astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on
archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world
experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific
research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the
paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data
analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper
authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of
both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical
accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current
frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under
20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain
experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific
research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale,
expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent
performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides
a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific
research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into
machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical
reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large
Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they
often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation
arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic
translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative
refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we
propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates
semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This
enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its
semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive
refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce
Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different
rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both
accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing
superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive
experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm
achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest
baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce
ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only
validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently
difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have exhibited substantial
potential for parallel text generation, which may enable more efficient
generation compared to autoregressive models. However, current dLLMs suffer
from fixed generation lengths, which indicates the generation lengths of dLLMs
have to be determined before decoding as a hyper-parameter, leading to issues
in efficiency and flexibility. To solve these problems, in this work, we
propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths,
abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately
predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to
natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability
of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over
traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to
autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama. Our method achieves higher
accuracy and faster inference, elevating dLLMs beyond mere academic novelty and
supporting their practical use in real-world applications. Codes and models
have been released.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention hinders the scalability of long-context LLMs,
especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing static sparse methods
such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to
reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent
variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has
proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend
on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce
generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their
accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods
for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention
(DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity
online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into
variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the
token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying
chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged
embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the
chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate
importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be
preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and
LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing
prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other
representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves
consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower
cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device
LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the release of new large language models (LLMs) like Llama and Mistral,
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has become increasingly feasible due to their
multilingual pretraining and strong generalization capabilities. However,
adapting these decoder-only LLMs to new tasks across languages remains
challenging. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as
soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored,
especially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a
comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual
transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis
further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as
the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix
methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark.
Similar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well. Despite using
only 1.23M learning parameters with prefix tuning, we achieve consistent
improvements across diverse benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential
of prefix-based techniques as an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA,
particularly in low-resource multilingual settings.

Abstract: Scaling laws describe how language models improve with additional data,
parameters, and compute. While widely used, they are typically measured on
aggregate test sets. Aggregate evaluations yield clean trends but average over
heterogeneous subpopulations, obscuring performance disparities. We introduce
relative scaling laws, which track how performance gaps between test
distributions evolve with scale rather than focusing solely on absolute error.
Using 255 decoder-only Transformers trained under matched-compute (IsoFLOP)
budgets from $10^{18}$--$10^{20}$ FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, we
find diverse trajectories: academic domains on MMLU converge toward parity;
regional English dialects shift depending on population size; and clusters of
AI risk behaviours split, with capability- and influence-related risks
increasing during pretraining while adversarial risks do not. These results
show that although scaling improves overall performance, it is not a universal
equalizer. To support further study, we release all model checkpoints from this
work to enable practitioners to measure relative alongside traditional scaling
laws, in order to better prioritize robustness challenges in light of the
bitter lesson.

Abstract: Maintaining mutual understanding is a key component in human-human

Other-Initiated Repair (OIR, when one speaker signals trouble and prompts the
other to resolve), plays a vital role. However, Conversational Agents (CAs)
still fail to recognize user repair initiation, leading to breakdowns or
disengagement. This work proposes a multimodal model to automatically detect
repair initiation in Dutch dialogues by integrating linguistic and prosodic
features grounded in Conversation Analysis. The results show that prosodic cues
complement linguistic features and significantly improve the results of
pretrained text and audio embeddings, offering insights into how different
features interact. Future directions include incorporating visual cues,
exploring multilingual and cross-context corpora to assess the robustness and
generalizability.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) have become essential for aligning large language models
(LLMs), serving as scalable proxies for human evaluation in both training and
inference. However, existing RMs struggle on knowledge-intensive and long-form
tasks, where evaluating correctness requires grounding beyond the model's
internal knowledge. This limitation hinders them from reliably discriminating
subtle quality differences, especially when external evidence is necessary. To
address this, we introduce OpenRM, a tool-augmented long-form reward model that
systematically judges open-ended responses by invoking external tools to gather
relevant evidence. We train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on over 27K synthesized pairwise examples generated through a
controllable data synthesis framework. The training objective jointly
supervises intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy, incentivizing
our reward model to learn effective evidence-based judgment strategies.
Extensive experiments on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used
benchmarks demonstrate that OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward
modeling approaches. As a further step, we integrate OpenRM into both
inference-time response selection and training-time data selection. This yields
consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks, highlighting the potential
of tool-augmented reward models for scaling reliable long-form evaluation.

Abstract: We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a
large-scale naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to
word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability), we model how
each feature influences dyslexic time costs. We find that all three features
robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that
dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially
predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially
narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing
the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align
with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working
memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical
complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In
short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and
offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for
dyslexics.

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes increasingly widespread, the
role of information retrieval (IR) is shifting from retrieving information for
human users to retrieving contextual knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI)
systems, where relevance becomes difficult to define or annotate beforehand. To
address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG
through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,
R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within
the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the
environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the
retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks
demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original
retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving
comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on
post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,
requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models
(LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to
manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and
commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static
case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive
exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We
present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health
records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and
recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for
realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via
end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that
optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce
DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated
examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written
rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across
diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10
state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two
prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34%
higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation
hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic
accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In
rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by
7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies
in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful
diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.

Abstract: Human evaluation of machine translation is in an arms race with translation
model quality: as our models get better, our evaluation methods need to be
improved to ensure that quality gains are not lost in evaluation noise. To this
end, we experiment with a two-stage version of the current state-of-the-art
translation evaluation paradigm (MQM), which we call MQM re-annotation. In this
setup, an MQM annotator reviews and edits a set of pre-existing MQM
annotations, that may have come from themselves, another human annotator, or an
automatic MQM annotation system. We demonstrate that rater behavior in
re-annotation aligns with our goals, and that re-annotation results in
higher-quality annotations, mostly due to finding errors that were missed
during the first pass.

Abstract: Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and
information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are
complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users
begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet
most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing
benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce
InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can
recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search.
Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we
construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a
target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only
through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best
model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context,
exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced
interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current
strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities
stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold,
revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate
feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for
both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents. The

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical
decision support systems, particularly in the
  context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common
practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),
  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,
residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied
  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model
reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This
  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to
evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,
  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.
We test this framework on three medical QA
  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to
assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our
  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the
medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they
  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of
distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation
  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core
decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform
  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the
cognitive complexity found in real-world medical
  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and
emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine
  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the
related code in the following repository:https:

Abstract: Self-improving systems require environmental interaction for continuous
adaptation. We introduce SPICE (Self-Play In Corpus Environments), a
reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts in two roles: a
Challenger that mines documents from a large corpus to generate diverse
reasoning tasks, and a Reasoner that solves them. Through adversarial dynamics,
the Challenger creates an automatic curriculum at the frontier of the
Reasoner's capability, while corpus grounding provides the rich,
near-inexhaustible external signal necessary for sustained improvement. Unlike
existing ungrounded self-play methods that offer more limited benefits, SPICE
achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning
(+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families. Our analysis reveals how
document grounding is a key ingredient in SPICE to continuously generate its
own increasingly challenging goals and achieve them, enabling sustained
self-improvement.

Abstract: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic
data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training
methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity
information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical
limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss"
samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final
answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We
address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our
empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of
ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final
answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a
dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect
samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to
effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse
question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO
consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our
analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also
induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls,
demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search
agents.

Abstract: Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their
capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data
synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve
alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the
AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality,
multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine
supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted
post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive
the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent
capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on
our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding
benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary
agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis
offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative
approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a
core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While
prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe
that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn
constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is
the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities
for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these
challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS
tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a
tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of
target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated
Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic,
Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and
efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that
are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized
for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both
basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp,
GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over
strong baselines.

Abstract: Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep
exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance
problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two
key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from
scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories
during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full
consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose
ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first
stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences
into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and
branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed
Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress
information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final
answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks
demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in
exploratory token consumption.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their
effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in
context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context
saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly
summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical
details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm
centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive
process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a
dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log
to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which
manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular
condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations
to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent
benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual
pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp
and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or
matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the
DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like
OpenAI's o4-mini.

Abstract: Public research results on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents
remain relatively rare, since the collection of agent training data presents
unique challenges. In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of
underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across
heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the
agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves
as an "interlingua" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent
training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to
capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding,
software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to
parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments,
we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP
format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for
multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an
average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers
state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool
use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data
are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to
standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) games require players to translate high-level semantic
actions into precise device manipulations using controllers and head-mounted
displays (HMDs). While humans intuitively perform this translation based on
common sense and embodied understanding, whether Large Language Models (LLMs)
can effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored. This paper
introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate
semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios
from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II,
and Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against
annotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while
top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition
capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial
understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across
games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples
substantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted
enhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities. We release all materials at

Abstract: In this paper, we present our submissions to the unified WMT25 Translation

model, GemSpanEval, trained to predict error spans along with their severities
and categories. Both systems are based on the state-of-the-art multilingual
open-weights model Gemma 3, fine-tuned on publicly available WMT data. We
demonstrate that MetricX-25, adapting Gemma 3 to an encoder-only architecture
with a regression head on top, can be trained to effectively predict both MQM
and ESA quality scores, and significantly outperforms its predecessor. Our
decoder-only GemSpanEval model, on the other hand, we show to be competitive in
error span detection with xCOMET, a strong encoder-only sequence-tagging
baseline. With error span detection formulated as a generative task, we
instruct the model to also output the context for each predicted error span,
thus ensuring that error spans are identified unambiguously.

Abstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified,
scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs.
Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale
continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and
simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse
trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual
loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that
balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS
achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on
open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in
unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet
in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that
the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and
multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action
representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path
toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity, I distinguish between
creative approaches and creative products, and introduce the concept of
disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific
expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in
mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity,
certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has
the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific
pursuit.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face
a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver
measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,
slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.
Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

and Large Language Model (LLM) based control are also implemented to assess
trade-offs in precision, adaptability, and implementation effort. Results show
that in modeling HAM provides the most balanced performance across accuracy,
generalization, and computational efficiency, while LSTM achieves high
precision at greater resource cost. Among controllers, MPC delivers robust and
predictable performance, RL demonstrates strong adaptability, and LLM-based
controllers offer flexible human-AI interaction when coupled with predictive
tools.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by large language models (LLMs) and endowed with
planning, tool use, memory, and autonomy, are emerging as powerful, flexible
platforms for automation. Their ability to autonomously execute tasks across
web, software, and physical environments creates new and amplified security
risks, distinct from both traditional AI safety and conventional software
security. This survey outlines a taxonomy of threats specific to agentic AI,
reviews recent benchmarks and evaluation methodologies, and discusses defense
strategies from both technical and governance perspectives. We synthesize
current research and highlight open challenges, aiming to support the
development of secure-by-design agent systems.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal
discovery methods.

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach
prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of
diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

Abstract: For doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence, it can't be a black box.
They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a
colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner.
It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot
embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital
and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four
model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving
$\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical
tasks.

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these
patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently
construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive,
and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
systems.

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the
deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

Abstract: We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools

constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially
explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant
mitigation assessment.

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and
transmission, yet their potential for representation learning remains largely
underexplored. We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed
rEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of
compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By
leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn
semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for
raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially
reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby
lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show
that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while
delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for
physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur
further research in generative modeling for inverse design. Code & data can be

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

Abstract: This PhD thesis investigates the societal impact of machine learning (ML). ML
increasingly informs consequential decisions and recommendations, significantly
affecting many aspects of our lives. As these data-driven systems are often

appropriate measurement of fairness in ML systems, systematic decomposition of
ML systems to anticipate bias dynamics, and effective interventions that reduce
algorithmic discrimination while maintaining system utility. I conclude by
discussing ongoing challenges and future research directions as ML systems,
including generative artificial intelligence, become increasingly integrated
into society. This work offers a foundation for ensuring that ML's societal
impact aligns with broader social values.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble
prediction of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly

discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, thereby unifying both. This
allows us to extend a major result known for the discounted-reward case to the
average-reward case: under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value
Iteration algorithm achieves a geometric convergence rate.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

computational graphs with rich metadata, spanning six major task categories
across multiple deep learning frameworks. To evaluate tensor compiler
performance on these samples, we propose the benchmark metric Speedup Score
S(t), which jointly considers runtime speedup and execution correctness under
tunable tolerance levels, offering a reliable measure of general optimization
capability. Furthermore, we extend S(t) to the Error-aware Speedup Score ES(t),
which incorporates error information and helps compiler developers identify key
performance bottlenecks. In this report, we benchmark the default tensor
compilers, CINN for PaddlePaddle and TorchInductor for PyTorch, on computer

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any
laboratory.

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid

turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally
prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this
work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)
architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy
of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy
spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain
generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately
reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle
annotation.

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial depen- dence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the
data-poor regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the num- ber of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algo- rithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Informa- tion Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, pro- viding the first
algorithm that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the
data-rich and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good
performance of SOIDS.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's
sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic
signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning
$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

colorectal cancer patients in the Hospital-Based Cancer Registries of S\~ao
Paulo, we evaluated Random Survival Forest (RSF), Gradient Boosting for

XGBoost-AFT (XGB-AFT), and LightGBM (LGBM), capable of predicting survival
considering censored data. Hyperparameter optimization was performed with
different samplers, and model performance was assessed using the Concordance
Index (C-Index), C-Index IPCW, time-dependent AUC, and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Survival curves produced by the models were compared with predictions
from classification algorithms, and predictor interpretation was conducted
using SHAP and permutation importance. XGB-AFT achieved the best performance
(C-Index = 0.7618; IPCW = 0.7532), followed by GBSA and RSF. The results
highlight the potential and applicability of MLSA to improve survival

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors,
fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock
onset classification. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating
treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional

log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Abstract: We are very delighted to see the fast development of physics-informed extreme
learning machine (PIELM) in recent years for higher computation efficiency and
accuracy in physics-informed machine learning. As a summary or review on PIELM
is currently not available, we would like to take this opportunity to show our
perspective and experience for this promising research direction. We can see
many efforts are made to solve PDEs with sharp gradients, nonlinearities,
high-frequency behavior, hard constraints, uncertainty, multiphysics coupling.
Despite the success, many urgent challenges remain to be tackled, which also
provides us opportunities to develop more robust, interpretable, and
generalizable PIELM frameworks with applications in science and engineering.

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable
predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current
limitations.

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. Most
ILP algorithms learn a single hypothesis from a single training run. Ensemble
methods train an ILP algorithm multiple times to learn multiple hypotheses. In
this paper, we train an ILP algorithm only once and save intermediate
hypotheses. We then combine the hypotheses using a minimum description length
weighting scheme. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks, including game
playing and visual reasoning, show that our approach improves predictive
accuracy by 4% with less than 1% computational overhead.

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.
